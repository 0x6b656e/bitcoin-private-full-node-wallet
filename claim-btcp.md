To claim your BTCP, please download the corresponding [release](https://github.com/BTCPrivate/bitcoin-private-full-node-wallet/releases).

Follow the instructions to set up the wallet, then open it and allow it to sync (to 100%).

Next, you will have to insert your private key. For your safety, we recommend moving your BTC and/or ZCL to a NEW ADDRESS before importing.

Go to wallet > import one private key and enter the private key. It will ask if you want to sweep - this will make a transaction sending it to a new address.

Press 'yes' to sweep to a new address, thereby claiming your Bitcoin Private. Be sure to document those new keys!

Your Bitcoin Private is now invulnerable to decay!
